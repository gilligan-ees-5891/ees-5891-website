<h3>Homework Exercises:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If you don’t have R installed on your computer, download and install R.
If you have a version of R older than 4.2,
you should update it to 4.2 or higher.</p>
<p>To install or upgrade R, download R version 4.2.1
from <a href="https://cran.rstudio.org">The Comprehensive R Archive Network</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Download and install the
<a href="https://cran.rstudio.org/bin/windows/">“base distribution” of R 4.2.1</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>MacOS:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Download and install <a href="https://cran.rstudio.org/bin/macosx/">R version 4.2.1</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Linux:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You should be able to install R from your Linux distribution’s package
manager:
<ul>
<li><code>sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev</code> for Debian or Ubuntu</li>
<li><code>sudo yum install R</code> or <code>sudo dnf install git</code> for Fedora,
Red Hat, and related distributions.</li>
<li>If you are using Ubuntu, there are
<a href="https://cran.rstudio.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/fullREADME.html">advanced instructions</a>
for configuring the package management system to use the very latest
versions of R and its associated packages at
<a href="https://cran.rstudio.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/fullREADME.html" class="uri">https://cran.rstudio.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/fullREADME.html</a>.
This is optional and the default version of R should be fine for this
class, as long as it is version 4.2 or higher.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>RStudio is a free editing and software development environment that makes it
much easier to work with R. I strongly recommend that you install RStudio
for this course.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to the download page for <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">the free desktop edition of RStudio</a> and
download the installer for your operating system. Windows, MacOS,
and the Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat, and openSUSE editions of
Linux are all supported.</p>
<p>There are other versions of RStudio (an expensive professional
edition and a server edition).
You want the <strong>free desktop edition</strong>.
As of August 2022, the latest version is RStudio Desktop version
2022.07.1+554.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the installer.</p></li>
<li><p>After the installer finishes running, run RStudio.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When RStudio starts up, the lower left part of the screen should have
a window that displays the R version, saying something like this:</p>

<p>The details will be different depending on your operating system, but
if you see something like this, RStudio correctly found R on your
computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Configuring RStudio for additional optional software. There are a few other
pieces of software that you may want to use this semester, but these
are not required.</p>
<p>If have installed the Git revision control system or the LaTeX
typesetting software, you should configure RStudio to use them:</p></li>
<li><p>If will use Git for software revision control with R, you should
open the “Tools” menu, and click on the “Global Options” choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the “Git/SVN” tab and click “enable version control interface
for RStudio projects”.
If RStudio can find the git program on your computer,
it will appear in the “git executable” field.
If RStudio can’t find it, you can help it by browsing to the
git program.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If you have installed LaTeX on your computer,
click on the SWeave tab, and select “knitr” for weaving
<code>.Rnw</code> files, and choose <code>pdfLaTeX</code> for typesetting LaTeX
files into PDF.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>After you have installed R and RStudio, you will need to install
a number of software packges that extend R for Bayesian data analysis.</p>
<p>The trickiest package to install is rstan. I recommend that you follow the
<a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started">detailed installation instructions</a>
on the RStan web site. There are instructions for Mac, Windows, and Linux.</p>
<p>Before you can install RStan, you will need to install a C++ compiler
and related tools before you can use RStan.
(Don’t worry, you won’t need to do any programming in C++.
Stan writes the C++ code for you, based on your description of the statistical
problem.)
Follow the instructions at the rstan web page for
<a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C---Toolchain-for-Mac">Mac</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C---Toolchain-for-Windows">Windows</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C-Toolchain-for-Linux">Linux</a></p>
<p>After you’ve done this, you can go to the
<a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started">main RStan installation instructions</a>
and continue from there.</p>
<p>If you run into difficulty, let me know and I will help you.</p></li>
<li><p>This will be a lot easier. Open RStudio, go to the “Console” window in
RStudio, and type</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(c(&quot;devtools&quot;, &quot;pacman&quot;))
library(pacman)
for (p in c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;ape&quot;, &quot;bayesplot&quot;, &quot;brms&quot;,
            &quot;broom&quot;, &quot;coda&quot;, &quot;dagitty&quot;, &quot;flextable&quot;,
            &quot;ggdag&quot;, &quot;ggformula&quot;, &quot;ggmcmc&quot;, &quot;ggrepel&quot;,
            &quot;ggthemes&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;loo&quot;, &quot;mvtnorm&quot;,
            &quot;patchwork&quot;, &quot;posterior&quot;, &quot;psych&quot;,
            &quot;rcartocolor&quot;, &quot;Rcpp&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;,
            &quot;rprojroot&quot;, &quot;sf&quot;, &quot;shiny&quot;, &quot;shinystan&quot;,
            &quot;statebins&quot;, &quot;tidybayes&quot;, &quot;viridis&quot;,
            &quot;viridisLite&quot;, &quot;wesanderson&quot;)) {
  p_install(p, character.only = TRUE, force = FALSE)
}
remotes::install_github(&quot;rmcelreath/rethinking&quot;)
remotes::install_github(&quot;mjskay/tidybayes.rethinking&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This may take some time to run, but when it is done, you should be good to go.</p></li>
<li><p>You will also need to install the <code>cmdstanr</code> package to run the <code>rethinking</code>
package.</p>
<p>The first step is to start a fresh R session or in RStudio open the “Session”
menu and choose “Restart R”. Then type this in the console window:</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;cmdstanr&quot;, repos = c(&quot;https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/&quot;,
                 getOption(&quot;repos&quot;)))</code></pre>
<p>Next, type this:</p>
<pre><code>library(cmdstanr)
check_cmdstan_toolchain(fix = TRUE, quiet = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>If this works without error, you should finally type this:</p>
<pre><code>install_cmdstan(cores = 2)</code></pre>
<p>If you are having difficulty installing <code>cmdstanr</code>, check
<a href="https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html">the documentation</a>
at the
<a href="https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html"><code>cmdstanr</code> web site</a>.</p></li>
