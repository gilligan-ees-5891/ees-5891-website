3. Model: Describe your statistical model. Focus on the main structure of your model. You won't have time to get into details about how you chose your proors, etc. 
4. Results: Describe the results of your analysis. Show graphs of your most interesting results
5. Conclusions: What did you learn from your analysis? How does this help you understand your research question or problem?
