### Notes on Homework:


Exercise 5E4 gets at a subtle point about independence of variables when you have indicators for categories. This connects to a subtle, but important point about _identifiability_ in models. When you can infer the exact value of a variable from other variables, then including the exactly predictable variable in your models can create problems by making the models _non-identifiable_. A good example is if you have indicator variables _male_ and _female_ for biological sex (for simplicity, I am leaving out the possibility of intersex individuals). If you have a regression model $y ~ \alpha + \beta_1 I_{\text{male}} + \beta_1 I_{\text{female}}$, then the model will predict the same result if you use parameters $\alpha' = \alpha + \delta$, $\beta'_1 = \beta_1 - \delta$, and $\beta'_2 = \beta_2 - \delta$. If you omit $I_{\text{male}}$ or $I_{\text{female}}$ from your model (but not both), you will have a model that works just as well (because $I_{\text{male}} = 1 - I_{\text{female}}$, so the model will have just as much information), but the model will now be completely _identifiable_ because we can't get equivalent results by changing $\alpha$ and $\beta$. This is why the kind of analysis in this exercise, to check whether a model is fully identifiable, is important.
