## Reading:

### Required Reading (everyone):

* Statistical Rethinking, Ch. 16 ("Generalized Linear Madness"), sections 16.1--16.2.

This section focuses on the connection between scientific models (based on scientific principles) and statistical models (based on statistical relationships), and how generative Bayesian models let us make the connections between the two kinds fo models clearer and more explicit.
